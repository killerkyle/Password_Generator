# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Honestly, I am going to admit I struggled with this for a while. Really struggled. 
I created something (alongside some of my group members) that would generate a password from 8-128 characters.
These characters include lower/upper case letters, numbers and symbols.
You will be asked a multitude of questions regarding what kind of characters you would like to have in your generated password.
Once you decide how many characters you want and what kind of characters you want, it will generate something per your specification.
